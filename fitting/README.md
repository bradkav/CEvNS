# Fitting

This folder contains some unmaintained, potentially broken code for performing likelihood fits to mock data. This was going to be used for calculating projected limits on non-standard neutrino interactions, but we've now moved to a different package for doing these calculations.

These files are here just for completeness sake - I can't vouch for what they do or what is written in them...
